How To Run
----------
Last time it seemed that compiling on your Linux machine using Swift worked out.
Compiling with any version of Swift equal to or higher than 4.0 should work again
this time.
So to get it built just make sure you have swift installed and enter the pa2 directory.
Also make sure the PA2_test.sql is in the pa2 directory.
Once you're in the directory run this command in terminal: "swift run pa2 PA2_test.sql"
It should build and run and print the output to the console.
